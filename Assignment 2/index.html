<!-- Home page
For my website project, I’ve chosen the context of a Music Album platform. 
Inspired by the clean and straightforward designs of music platforms like 
SoundCloud and Apple Music, I aim to keep the interface minimal, allowing
the content—such as albums and music videos—to take center stage. 
Additionally, drawing inspiration from the dynamic visual effect of 2023palate
website from Assignment 1,I want to use playful animations on the homepage to 
make it more engaging. Specifically, I plan to use album cover images that 
transform into pixelated fragments when hovered over, revealing text such
as "New Album Dropped." With this subtle but dynamic interaction, the browsing 
experience will be more attractive and interactive for the user. -->
